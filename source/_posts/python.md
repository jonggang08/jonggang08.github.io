lede: Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn. However, that doesn't mean that it's easy!

``` bash
$ hexo new "My New Post"
print("Hello World")
```


Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack of
pre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, so that they can snag
programmers and UX designers who really stand out.  Instead of spending valuable
time validating a particularly promising candidate's skillset through a
protracted series of interviews, it's often more efficient to simply **give the
individual an offer right then and there**.
